# Regex Tutorial

In this tutorial, I will explain the concept of Regex in relation to Email addresses. I will be breaking down each part of this Regex expression and describing what it does and how it is relevant. 

## Summary

What is Regex? Regex, also know as Regular Expressions, is a sequence of character that are used to define a search pattern for text. Historically, regex comes from a mathematical expression called regular sets, but for our purposes, they are used to define a search pattern in a body of text. For this tutorial, I will be explaining the Regex of an email address. Below is a look at the regex for email addresses. 

```
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```
